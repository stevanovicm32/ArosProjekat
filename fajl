The King and his men
stole the Queen from her bed
and bound her in her bones
the seas be ours and by the powers
where we will we'll roam

Yo ho, all hands
Hoist the colors high
Heave ho, thieves and beggars
Never shall we die

Now some have died
and some are alive
and others sail on sea
with the keys to the cage
and the Devil to pay
we lay to Fiddler's Green.

Yo ho, haul together
Hoist the colours high
Heave ho, thieves and beggars
Never shall we die

The bell has been raised
from it's water grave
Hear it's sepulchral tone?
A call to all
pay heed the squall
and turn yourself toward home

Yo ho, haul together
Hoist the colors high
Heave ho, thieves and beggars
Never shall we die

Yo ho, haul together
Hoist the colors high
Heave ho, thieves and beggars
Never shall we die

Yo ho, haul together
Hoist the colors high
Heave ho, thieves and beggars
Never shall we die

The King and his men
stole the Queen from her bed
and bound her in her bones.
The seas be ours and by the powers
Where we will we'll roam.
